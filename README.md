## Abstract

This study evaluated hypothetical participation in temporary voluntary removal of firearms from the home to reduce future suicide risk in 408 adult male firearm owners. A delay discounting approach was applied to evaluate the degree to which these choices were influenced by two dimensions of reinforcer efficacyâ€”Delay and Magnitude. The decision-making task sampled choice behavior across various durations of temporary voluntary removal of firearms (Delay) and differences in stated potential risk of suicide (Magnitude) as a result of that choice. Results of mixed-effects modeling indicated that the subjective value of immediate access to a firearm was differentially sensitive to both Delay and Magnitude. Additionally, the scaling of these effects was linked to various other indicators of firearm-specific safety (e.g., use of trigger locks) and suicidality risk (e.g., intolerance of uncertainty). These results provide additional support for behavioral models of decision-making (i.e., delay discounting) when evaluating how specific environmental arrangements and framing may support (or potentially discourage) engagement in means safety activities, inclusive of temporary firearms access restriction. These findings suggest that further analysis of the ecological underpinnings of these choices may help to guide more targeted efforts to engage with firearm owners in safety planning when there are concerns about the potential for suicide.
